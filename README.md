# MCMC-Visualization-Project

Project Introduction

* The first aim of this stochastic models and simulation project is to understand the metropolis-hastings algorithm and several markov-chain-monte-carlo diagnostic methods at a more intuitive and visual level through plots that are both animated and interactive. My second aim is to present my first aim in a cohesive and compect manner to those unfamiliar with MCMC and the R-Programming Language. It is important to mention that the time-dependent nature of a markov chain and the amount of visually appealing parameters are optimal for creating animated illustrations. The next step I will take for this project is to add a tab that brings all other concepts together in one cohesive analysis.
