# MCMC-Visualization-Project

## Project Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a Shiny app designed to provide an intuitive and visual understanding of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and several Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostic methods.

## Project Aims
The project has two main aims:

1. To understand the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and several MCMC diagnostic methods at a more intuitive and visual level through animated and interactive plots.
2. To present the first aim in a cohesive and compact manner to those unfamiliar with MCMC and the R-Programming Language.
Why MCMC

## Why MCMC and R?

MCMC methods are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The more steps that are included, the more closely the distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution.

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

## Features
The app provides a visual and interactive way to understand the time-dependent nature of a Markov chain and the amount of visually appealing parameters optimal for creating animated illustrations.

## Live Demo
You can access the live demo of the app [here](https://franklinfuchs.shinyapps.io/MCMC_Visual_Project/).
